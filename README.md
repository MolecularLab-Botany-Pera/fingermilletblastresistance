# fingermilletblastresistance
This repository contains sequences of resistance genes and resistance gene analogs (RGAs) collocated with resistance QTLs associated with blast resistance in rice; genomic and transcriptomic sequences of finger millet orthologs of the rice RGAs; and alignments of gene specific primers designed for the finger millet orthologs. Blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogenic species of the genera Pyricularia (Magnaporthe) is one of the most common diseases found in many cereals. A comparative genomics study was conducted to identify blast Resistance Gene Aanalogs (RGAs) from diverse cereal species using rice as a model. The outcome catalogued 89 cereal orthologs of rice RGA.
